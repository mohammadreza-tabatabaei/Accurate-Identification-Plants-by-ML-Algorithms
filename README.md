# Dataset:
I myself created very limited dataset by 40 images of plants.This dataset included the images of two plants. So that each plant had twenty images in this dataset.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing plants' images. The recognition phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires.
